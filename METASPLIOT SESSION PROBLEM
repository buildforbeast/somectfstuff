It happens with me  when getting reverse shell in metasploit when I  again set payload and lport its says already running 


So to first search if ports are still running 

Netstat -anpl | grep <port no >
If yes then kill it 
Or 
You can use
Sudo lsof -i:<port> { if metasploit port are still listening }


Kill it with
Sudo kill -9 PID  you find in above lsof step the PID
