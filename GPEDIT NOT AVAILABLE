Faced a problem of command gpedit.msc while run but found that this command is turn of for windows home edition users  

So we have to add a line using  command prompt in administrator mode


FOR %F IN (“%SystemRoot%\servicing\Packages\Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy-ClientTools-Package~*.mum”) DO (DISM /Online /NoRestart /Add-Package:”%F”)
FOR %F IN (“%SystemRoot%\servicing\Packages\Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy-ClientExtensions-Package~*.mum”)
DO (DISM /Online /NoRestart /Add-Package:”%F”)

DISM 
   is a deployment  management tool for windows features and services installer
